# cs30-class-demos
Live-code demos for Computer Science 30 at WMCI.

## p5js Web Editor Demos
At the start of the semester, I will use the p5js web editor. You can find those demos here:

- [Period 2 p5js web editor demos](https://editor.p5js.org/schellenberg/collections/ISqSWyyHq)
- [Period 5 p5js web editor demos](https://editor.p5js.org/schellenberg/collections/o3gInvphc)

## VS Code Demos
For the rest of the semester, the live versions of the demos can be seen here (to see the code, just navigate through the folders above):
- [Period 2 VS Code Demos](https://schellenberg.github.io/cs30-class-demos/Period-2)
- [Period 5 VS Code Demos](https://schellenberg.github.io/cs30-class-demos/Period-5)

## Usage

You can, of course, simply view the code that we have created together here on the GitHub website. However, the best way to use this GitHub repository is to click the "Clone or download" button (on the right side at the top of this page) and select "Open in Desktop". Now you just need to choose where on your local computer you'd like to save all of our class demos. You can clone this repository at home to have easy access to all the demos there as well. To update your folder to include the most recent demos, open GitHub Desktop, select the cs20-demos repository, and click on the "Fetch Origin" button. From then on, whenever you want to get the latest demos on your machine, just open GitHub Desktop, and click on the "Fetch Origin" button.

## Troubleshooting

One of the most common errors that students encounter happens when they edit the demos inside the folder they have cloned to their local machine. This will cause problems when you click "Fetch Origin", since GitHub tries to update the folder to match the current state found online, but will not know what to do about the file(s) that you have changed locally. **To avoid this, make a copy of the demo you would like to edit, and save it somewhere other than the cs30-class-demos folder.**
